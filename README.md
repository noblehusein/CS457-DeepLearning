# CS457-DeepLearning
1)  building software for an Artificial Neural Network using the Vectorization facilities of Python.

2) We use either Keras on the MNIST dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset, each of which has 10 distinct classes with exactly one object class in any image. 
   we develop a program which should be able to identify the object in each image in the respective datasets with high accuracy.
